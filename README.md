## Description
Given our financial background, we decided to focus on on financial markets and their sensitivity to external factors. Given the recent pandemic, and the ready availability of market data, this led us to ask the following questions:

What impact has the market had on market values?
Which industries are doing best since the virus hit? 


## Data Sources
Initially we agreed to focus on monthly stock data and quarterly returns (which are in the public domain), to be sourced via webscraping from yahoo finance. 

In doing so, we found stock data to be readily available, but quarterly returns were often not reported or there were holes in the reporting, so we shifted focus just to the stock data. 

In order to be able to scrape this data from yahoo finance, we needed all the tickers of each of the companies listed on the exchange. Once we had these, they acted as unique identifiers to be able to pull the data needed. I have included links to the data that we sourced below:


## Workflow
We decided to make best use of the campus being open and collaborated there, in person. This allowed us to brainstorm ideas, create a physical kanban board and to communicate effectively. Our strength in this project was being realistic in our goals and what we could acheive while working full time. We set out to answer the above two questions, but found ourselves with extra time which allowed us to push this further and dive deeper in to additional data.
